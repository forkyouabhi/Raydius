About The Project
Raydius is a closed-community dating application designed exclusively for university students. It combines the discoverability of Happn, the depth of Hinge, and the simplicity of Tinder, all within a secure, university-only environment.

The goal is to provide a safe, relevant, and engaging platform for students to make genuine connections with peers they cross paths with every day on campus.

Core Features:

‚úÖ University Domain Verification: Ensures exclusivity by allowing sign-ups only from whitelisted university email domains.

üîë Secure OTP Authentication: Passwordless login using one-time codes sent directly to the user's university email.

üë§ In-Depth Profile Creation: Users can build a detailed profile with photos, personal information, interests, and ice-breaker prompts.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Swiping & Matching: A familiar card-swiping interface to like or pass on profiles, with mutual likes resulting in a match.

üí¨ Real-time Chat: Once matched, users can communicate through a private, secure chat.

Built With
This project is built with a modern, full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript toolchain.
